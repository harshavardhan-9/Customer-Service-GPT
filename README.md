## ðŸŽ¬ Demos

### ðŸ“… Appointment booking

An AI medical assistant helps users book appointments at the clinic by trying to find matching availability, answering questions, and collecting necessary information to confirm the appointment

```bash
poetry run python -m examples.appointment_booking.example_booking_bot
```

### ðŸ’‡ Duplex clone

This bot replicates the Google Duplex demo, in which an AI schedules a hair salon appointment. The AI is the customer assistant and the User is the hair salon attendant.
```bash
poetry run python -m examples.appointment_booking.example_duplex_bot
```

Sure! Here's a simpler, cleaner README with the **Demos first**, followed by a clear explanation of what the project is and its goals â€” no code or quick start sections:

## What is Customer-Service-GPT?

Customer-Service-GPT is an experimental toolkit designed to build and explore **LLM-powered process-driven chatbots**. These chatbots guide users through tasks by following step-by-step processes â€” like opening a bank account or scheduling appointments â€” making interactions simple and structured.

The project uses modern AI and Python libraries such as Pydantic and Langchain to handle dialogue, context, and entity recognition.

## Project Goals

* **Contextual Named Entity Recognition**: Extract relevant information from user inputs by understanding context, e.g., knowing which date/time the user refers to in a list of options.

* **Dialogue State Management**: Manage conversation flow by tracking collected information, validating it, and guiding the user through each step of a process.

* **Flexible and Extensible**: Provide a framework to quickly build custom task-driven chatbots that can be adapted for different domains.

* **Experimentation Platform**: Serve as a playground for testing ideas around conversational AI, entity extraction, and multi-turn dialogue logic.

This toolkit is currently experimental and not intended for production use. It works best with advanced LLMs like GPT-4 for natural and coherent task-driven conversations.
